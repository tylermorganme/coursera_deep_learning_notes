# Neural Network
- Deep learning refers to training large neural networks.
- Neural networks are most useful in supervised learning problems.
- Almost all of the economic value of neural networks has come from supervised learning problems.
- Major fields:
  - Marketing
  - Speech Recognition
  - Image Recognition
- Structured Data: has a very well defined structure like a database.
- Unstructured Data: data like audio, images, and text that is not categorized into a structure.
- Most of the value up to this point from neural networks has come from working with structured data.
## Why Are Neural Networks Popular Now?
- Traditional machine learning algorithms tend to have performance plateau with data sets over a certain size.
- As neural networks get larger, their performance tends to keep improving as data sets get larger.
- With smaller data sets other types of algorithms may perform better, but large neural networks pretty much dominate performance for large data sets.
- Neural networks have moved from using sigmoid functions to using ReLU functions because performing gradient operations on the sigmoid function is very computationally intensive.

TODO: Look into Generative Adversarial Nets.
